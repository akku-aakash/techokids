              Coding is just a set of instructions given to a computer to do
              what we want it to do. It is used to create games, websites, apps,
              etc. In todayâ€™s digital world, every single digital application or
              website we use runs on coding functionalities. Coding for kids has
              become very necessary in the 21st Century.
